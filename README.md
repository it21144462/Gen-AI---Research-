# Generative AI Chat Bots for Education  

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our final year research project: **Generative AI Chat Bot to Aid Students in Learning Specific Module Areas**. The project involves three AI-powered chatbots tailored to assist students in different learning domains:  

1. **Programming Bot**  
2. **Maths Bot**  
3. **English Bot**  

## Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to leverage generative AI to create intelligent and interactive chatbots that support students in learning specific subjects. Each bot is designed to provide a unique learning experience, addressing subject-specific challenges and enhancing students' understanding through guided interaction.  

### Features  

- **Programming Bot**  
  Provides coding assistance, debugging help, and explanations for concepts in languages such as Java, C++, and Python.  

- **Maths Bot**  
  Solves mathematical problems, explains concepts, and assists with equations and step-by-step solutions.  

- **English Bot**  
  Offers grammar checks, vocabulary building, essay guidance, and language practice.  

### Technical Details  

- **Models**: Ollama AI models running locally for optimal performance.  
- **Environment**: Models operate on local machines to ensure data privacy and security.  
- **Dependencies**: Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the Python packages needed.  
- **Architecture**: A modular design that separates functionality for each chatbot, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
